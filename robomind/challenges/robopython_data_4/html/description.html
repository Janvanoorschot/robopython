<p>
    A “dictionary” is an unordered data structure that contains a collection of elements.
    To find an element, you must know the “key” of the element.
    Create dictionaries using curly braces {}.
    You can create a dictionary with content by putting every element
    you want in it between the curly braces,
    with the syntax key: value, and commas between the elements.
    To find a value associated with a specific key,
    use the same syntax as for a list,
    except that where you write the index for a list,
    you write the searched key for a dictionary.
