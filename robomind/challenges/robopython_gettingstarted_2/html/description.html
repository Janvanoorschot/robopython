    Press the Run button again and carefully look at the editor while Robo
    is executing your Python script. You will see a small cursor that
    follows the line Robo is currently executing. Try this a couple of time.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Now before pressing the Run button, click before line 8. A red dot will appear, indicating
    a so-called 'breakpoint' on that line.

<p class="instruction">
    Now before pressing the Run button, click in the number 8 before line 8. A red dot will appear, indicating
    a so-called 'breakpoint' on that line.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    With the breakpoint in place press the Run button again. Robo will stop execution
    when arrived on the line with the breakpoint giving you time to read the message
    generated by the instruction 'robo.message()'. Press Run again and
    Robo will continue.
