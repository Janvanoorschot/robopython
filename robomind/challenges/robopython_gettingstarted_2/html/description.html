<h1>Robomind Python development environment</h1>

<p>
    The Robomind Academy programming environment works the same when using the Robomind language or
    when using the Python language. Lets try.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Press the Run button again and carefully look at the editor while Robo
    is executing your Python script. You will see a small cursor that
    follows the line Robo is currently executing. Try this a couple of time.
</p>

<p>
    When using Python you can use breakpoints to pause execution of your Solution.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Before pressing the Run button, click before line 8. A red dot will appear, indicating
    a 'breakpoint' is active on that line.
</p>

<p>
    Now it is time to test that breakpoint.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    With the breakpoint in place press the Run button again. Robo will stop execution
    when arrived on the line with the breakpoint giving you time to read the message
    generated by the instruction 'robo.message()'. Press Run again and
    Robo will continue.
</p>
