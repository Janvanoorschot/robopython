<p>
    Typically Robo talks the Robomind language. The Robomind language is simple and allows you to
    just type 'forward' and Robo will take one step forward. The use of a simple language allows
    you to concentrate on learning Computational Thinking.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use the <a href="www.python.org">Python</a> language to program Robo.
    Python is a powerful language used for just about everything. Just start your
    program with the line '#!python' and Robo will know you are talking in the Python language
    (eat your heart out Harry).

<p>
    A note of warning. Before doing the Python course you really should first do the  'Basics 1' course.
    Without a working knowledge of Computational Thinking learning Python will be hard.

<p  class="instruction">
    Press the Run button and Robo will execute your first Python program. Have a look
    at the Python code and try to recognise some familiar components.
