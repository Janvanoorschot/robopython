<p>
    The <code>for</code> loop executes a code block for each item in a sequence. The robomind
    language does not know a sequence so this is new. For now, we only use one type of sequence, the 'range'.
    The statement <code>range(10)</code> with generate a sequence of ten numbers from 0 to 9.
    The following shows the number of 0 to 9 as a message (use a breakpoint to view each message):
</p>

<code>
    for w in range(10):
        robo.message(f"number: {w}")
</code>

<p class="instruction">
    Paint a line of 1, turn right,
    Paint a line of 2, turn right,
    Paint a line of 3, turn right,
    Paint a line of 4, turn right,
    Paint a line of 5, turn right.
    Oh yes, use a <code>for</code> loop!
