<p>
    Let's start with a simple Python program that gives Robo a sequence of simple commands.
<p>

<p class="instruction">
    Pick up the beacon and put it down in the lower left corner of the map. Use
    the following instructions: (scroll down to the 'Basic Instructions' section of Help for a
    complete list):
</p>

<pre>
    robo.right()
    robo.forward()
    robo.pickUp()
    robo.putDown()
</pre>

<p>
    Like with the Robomind language, in Python you can pass arguments to each instruction.
    Most of the instructions (also called 'methods' or 'functions') that Robo understand
    accept a single number as argument. For example, the following instruction tells
    Robo to move three paces forwards:
</p>

<pre>
    robo.forward(3)
</pre>
