<p>
    You use a function to keep the logic of your Solution in one place and
    hide the complexity. In the future you only have to call the function
    without having to look at (or remember) the complexity.
</p>

<p>
    Functions that belong together are kept in a library. To get an idea
    of how many publically available Python libraries there are, have
    a look at <a href="https://pypi.org/">Python Package Index</a>.

<p class="instruction">
    Create a function <code>function_a</code> that paints the letter A (see picture for size).

    Call the function to show that it works.
