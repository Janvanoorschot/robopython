<h1>Break the Loop</h1>

<p>
    The <code>break</code> statement makes it possible to prematurely terminate a loop (for or while).
    When Python encounters a break, it stops processing the current loop.
    Processing continues with the first line of code after the loop.
</p>


<p>
    As an example, the following code walks forward while
    there is a wall to the right (robo.rightIsObjstacle() is True)
    and there is no obstacle in front (robo.frontIsObstacle() is False).
    Stop immediately when there is something in front of Robo.
</p>

<code>
    while robo.rightIsObstacle():
        if not robo.frontIsObstacle():
            robo.forward()
        else:
            break
</code>

<p class="instruction">
    Go down to the black line and follow that line to the right until
    there is a wall to the right of Robo. Use the <code>break</code> instruction in
    your Solution.
</p>
