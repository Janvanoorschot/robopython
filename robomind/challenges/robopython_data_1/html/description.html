<p>
  Variables are used in Python to store data for later use. For example:
</p>

<pre>
  variable_1 = 10
  variable_1 = variable_1 - 1
  if variable_1 == 9:
    robo.message("yes!!!")
</pre>

<p>
  Lots of different types of data can be stored in a variables such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A number such as 1, 2 or 3</li>
  <li>A string such as "hello world"</li>
  <li>A boolean such as True or False</li>
  <li>A reference to a function such as <code>paint_line</code></li>
  <li>A reference to an object such as <code>robo</code></li>
  <li>A list of things such as <code>[1, "hello world", robo]</code></li>
</ul>
