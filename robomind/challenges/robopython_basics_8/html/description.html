    The <code>continue</code> statement will stop the execution of
    current code block and restart that code block.

<p>
    Both the <code>break</code>
    and the <code>continue</code> can be used in a <code>for</code> and ina
    <code>while</code> loop.
    In a while loop this means that the boolean expression is reevaluated.
    In a for loop it means that the next item of the sequence is taken.
