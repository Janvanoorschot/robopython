<p>
    If the <em>continue</em> statement in a block of code with a loop (for or while),
    the current cycle in the loop is immediately terminated, and
    the next iteration of the loop is started.
    For a while loop this means that the boolean expression is reevaluated,
    and for a for loop it means that the next item of the collection is taken.

    Pickup the beacon by using a while loop and a continue statement.
