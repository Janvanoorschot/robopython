<p>
    Like the Robomind language, Python provides an <code>if</code> statement to
    conditionaly execute statements. The <code>if</code> in Python looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
if x < 0:
   x = 0
   print('Negative changed to zero')
elif x == 0:
   print('Zero')
elif x == 1:
   print('Single')
else:
   print('More')
</pre>
<p>
    No curly braces and an extra construct <code>elif</code> that is short for
    the Robomind language <code>else if</code>, but for the rest ... looks familiar!!.
</p>
<p class="instruction">
    Create four if/else statements that check if there is an obstacle in front of Robo.
    Move backward if there is, move forward if there is none.
</p>

<p>
    The conditions of the if statement are so-called logical expressions.
    Such an expression will result in the value True or False in Python (note the capital 'T' and 'F')
    which is then used to decide to step to the appropriate part of the code to resume execution.
    Basic instructions may also be composed with the boolean operators not, and, or.
