<p>
    Sometimes one of the arguments to a function almost has the same value and
    only sometimes has some non-standard value. In that case you can
    use a named variable with a default value.

<pre>
#!python
# Challenge: Use a named variable.

def paint_line(length, turn=False):
    if turn:
        robo.right(1)
    robo.paintWhite()
    robo.forward(length)
    robo.stopPainting()

paint_line(2)
paint_line(2)
</pre>

<p class="instruction">
    Try out the Solution given above. Then try to recreate the picture the right by adding a named variable.
