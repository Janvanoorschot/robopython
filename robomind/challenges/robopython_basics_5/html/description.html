<p>Paint a stair</p>

<p>
    A for-loop has a variable, the so-called loop variable.
    You can name this loop variable yourself and use it in the code block.
    Each time the code block is executed the variable has the current value of
    the sequence.

<p>
    Paint a white stairs where each tread is one position long. Use a
    for loop and the range operator to create a sequence.
