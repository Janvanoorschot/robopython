    A for-loop has a variable, the so-called loop variable.
    Programmers often name this variable i (from integer) but you can choose your own name.
    After the word in it must be specified within which range of i the code
    of the for-loop must be executed. I.e.: for i in range(10):
    print(i)  For every i in range 10 the programm should print 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.
