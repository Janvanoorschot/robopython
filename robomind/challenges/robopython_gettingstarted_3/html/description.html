<p>
    Just like in the Robomind language, in the Python language
    you can instruct Robo to do something by giving Robo
    instructions. In the Robomind language you would do that by
    just include the instruction in your script like this:
</p>

<code>
    forward

</code>

<p>
    In the Python language you give Robo the same instruction by
    using the following line in your script:
</p>

<code>
    robo.forward()

</code>

<p class="instruction">
    Press to Run button to see some of the instructions in action.
    Open the <em>Help</em> section below and have a look at all instructions there
    are to instruct Robo.
