<p>
    A while loop is very similar to an if statement.
    Both statements only execute the corresponding code if an equation is True.
    The difference is that with an if statement this code is only executed once.
    With a while loop, the code runs as long as the equation remains True.

<p class="instruction">
    Let robo move around the wall opposing robo (see picture) and paint it white.
    First walk to the wall and position Robo looking left.
    Then start painting and walk round the building.
