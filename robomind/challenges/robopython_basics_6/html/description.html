<p>
    A while loop is very similar to an if statement.
    Both statements only execute the corresponding code if an equation is True.
    The difference is that with an if statement this code is only executed once.
    With a while loop, the code runs as long as the equation remains True.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes you want to escape the while loop before the current
    code block is done. The <code>break</code> instruction does just that.
    The <code>continue</code> statement will stop the execution of
    current code block and restart the code block. Both instructions also
    work in a <code>for</code> loop.

    Let robo move around the wall opposing robo (see picture) and paint it white.
    First walk to the wall and position Robo looking left.
    Then start painting and walk round the building.
