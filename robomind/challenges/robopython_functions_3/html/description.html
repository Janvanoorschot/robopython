<p class="instruction">
    Start a Letter library by writing a function <code>function_b</code> that draws the letter B (see picture).
</p>

<p>
    Both functions expect Robo to be in a free location without paint
    and pointing upwards. We call this the expected  'start condition'
    of each function. In order for the above code to work the 'end condition'
    of every function in our library must be the 'start condition' of the
    next function.  So after drawing every letter Robo should end up on the place where
    the next letter should start and should point upwards.
    Adjust your <code>function_b</code>  and try to write 'ABA'
