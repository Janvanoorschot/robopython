<p>
    Extend the program.
    Move forward if there is no obstacle  in front of you
    Turn right if there is an obstacle in front of you
    Using while loops and the not operator.
</p>

<p>
    A while statement executes a code block (after the : ) repeatedly,
    but only while a certain condition is True.
    A while statement stops executing when the condition becomes False.
    You can use the operator 'not' as wel;.
