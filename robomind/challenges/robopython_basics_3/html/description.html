<p>
    A while statement executes a code block (after the : ) repeatedly as long as the condition
    evaluates to True. The while statement stops executing when the condition becomes False.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Move forward while there is no obstacle  in front of you.
    Then turn right and do the same again.
    Use while loops and the not operator.
