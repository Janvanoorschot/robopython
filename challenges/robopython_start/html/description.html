<p>
    Robo can move, paint and pick up things.
    Let's have a look how we can make Robo to do these things....
</p>

<p>
    At the bottom of the script editor you see a kind of remote control with which you can give instructions to the robot.
    Of course you can also directly write commands in the script editor.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    To the lower right of the robot there is a beacon.
    Let the robot pick it up by giving him the correct commands.
</p>

<p>
    Use the script editor to give the robot commands.
    Push <img src="/content/gettingStartedGetBeacon/images/web_playonly_button_20x23.jpg"> to see the result.
    You can also push <img src="/content/gettingStartedGetBeacon/images/web_steponly_button_15x17.jpg"> to go through your script step-by-step.
